=== `Marshaller` and `Unmarshaller`

As stated in the xref:oxm:oxm-introduction.adoc#oxm-introduction[introduction], a marshaller serializes an object
to XML, and an unmarshaller deserializes XML stream to an object. This section describes
the two Spring interfaces used for this purpose.


[[oxm-marshaller]]
==== Understanding `Marshaller`

Spring abstracts all marshalling operations behind the
`org.springframework.oxm.Marshaller` interface, the main method of which follows:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
.Java
----
	public interface Marshaller {

		/**
		 * Marshal the object graph with the given root into the provided Result.
		 */
		void marshal(Object graph, Result result) throws XmlMappingException, IOException;
	}
----
[source,kotlin,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="secondary"]
.Kotlin
----
	interface Marshaller {

		/**
		* Marshal the object graph with the given root into the provided Result.
		*/
		@Throws(XmlMappingException::class, IOException::class)
		fun marshal(
				graph: Any,
				result: Result
		)
	}
----


The `Marshaller` interface has one main method, which marshals the given object to a
given `javax.xml.transform.Result`. The result is a tagging interface that basically
represents an XML output abstraction. Concrete implementations wrap various XML
representations, as the following table indicates:

[[oxm-marshller-tbl]]
|===
| Result implementation| Wraps XML representation

| `DOMResult`
| `org.w3c.dom.Node`

| `SAXResult`
| `org.xml.sax.ContentHandler`

| `StreamResult`
| `java.io.File`, `java.io.OutputStream`, or `java.io.Writer`
|===

NOTE: Although the `marshal()` method accepts a plain object as its first parameter, most
`Marshaller` implementations cannot handle arbitrary objects. Instead, an object class
must be mapped in a mapping file, be marked with an annotation, be registered with the
marshaller, or have a common base class. Refer to the later sections in this chapter
to determine how your O-X technology manages this.


[[oxm-unmarshaller]]
==== Understanding `Unmarshaller`

Similar to the `Marshaller`, we have the `org.springframework.oxm.Unmarshaller`
interface, which the following listing shows:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
.Java
----
	public interface Unmarshaller {

		/**
		 * Unmarshal the given provided Source into an object graph.
		 */
		Object unmarshal(Source source) throws XmlMappingException, IOException;
	}
----
[source,kotlin,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="secondary"]
.Kotlin
----
	interface Unmarshaller {

		/**
		* Unmarshal the given provided Source into an object graph.
		*/
		@Throws(XmlMappingException::class, IOException::class)
		fun unmarshal(source: Source): Any
	}
----

This interface also has one method, which reads from the given
`javax.xml.transform.Source` (an XML input abstraction) and returns the object read. As
with `Result`, `Source` is a tagging interface that has three concrete implementations. Each
wraps a different XML representation, as the following table indicates:

[[oxm-unmarshller-tbl]]
|===
| Source implementation| Wraps XML representation

| `DOMSource`
| `org.w3c.dom.Node`

| `SAXSource`
| `org.xml.sax.InputSource`, and `org.xml.sax.XMLReader`

| `StreamSource`
| `java.io.File`, `java.io.InputStream`, or `java.io.Reader`
|===

Even though there are two separate marshalling interfaces (`Marshaller` and
`Unmarshaller`), all implementations in Spring-WS implement both in one class.
This means that you can wire up one marshaller class and refer to it both as a
marshaller and as an unmarshaller in your `applicationContext.xml`.


[[oxm-xmlmappingexception]]
==== Understanding `XmlMappingException`

Spring converts exceptions from the underlying O-X mapping tool to its own exception
hierarchy with the `XmlMappingException` as the root exception.
These runtime exceptions wrap the original exception so that no information will be lost.

Additionally, the `MarshallingFailureException` and `UnmarshallingFailureException`
provide a distinction between marshalling and unmarshalling operations, even though the
underlying O-X mapping tool does not do so.

The O-X Mapping exception hierarchy is shown in the following figure:
