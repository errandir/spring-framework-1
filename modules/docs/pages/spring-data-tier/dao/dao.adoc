== DAO Support

The Data Access Object (DAO) support in Spring is aimed at making it easy to work with
data access technologies (such as JDBC, Hibernate, or JPA) in a consistent way. This
lets you switch between the aforementioned persistence technologies fairly easily,
and it also lets you code without worrying about catching exceptions that are
specific to each technology.
