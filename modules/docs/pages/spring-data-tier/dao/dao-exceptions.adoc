=== Consistent Exception Hierarchy

Spring provides a convenient translation from technology-specific exceptions, such as
`SQLException` to its own exception class hierarchy, which has `DataAccessException` as
the root exception. These exceptions wrap the original exception so that there is never any
risk that you might lose any information about what might have gone wrong.

In addition to JDBC exceptions, Spring can also wrap JPA- and Hibernate-specific exceptions,
converting them to a set of focused runtime exceptions.
This lets you handle most non-recoverable persistence exceptions
in only the appropriate layers, without having annoying boilerplate
catch-and-throw blocks and exception declarations in your DAOs. (You can still trap
and handle exceptions anywhere you need to though.) As mentioned above, JDBC
exceptions (including database-specific dialects) are also converted to the same
hierarchy, meaning that you can perform some operations with JDBC within a consistent
programming model.

The preceding discussion holds true for the various template classes in Spring's support for various ORM
frameworks. If you use the interceptor-based classes, the application must care
about handling `HibernateExceptions` and `PersistenceExceptions` itself, preferably by
delegating to the `convertHibernateAccessException(..)` or
`convertJpaAccessException()` methods, respectively, of `SessionFactoryUtils`. These methods convert the exceptions
to exceptions that are compatible with the exceptions in the `org.springframework.dao`
exception hierarchy. As `PersistenceExceptions` are unchecked, they can  get
thrown, too (sacrificing generic DAO abstraction in terms of exceptions, though).

The following image shows the exception hierarchy that Spring provides. (Note that the
class hierarchy detailed in the image shows only a subset of the entire
`DataAccessException` hierarchy.)
