== Feedback and Contributions

For how-to questions or diagnosing or debugging issues, we suggest using StackOverflow,
and we have a https://spring.io/questions[questions page] that lists the suggested tags to use.
If you're fairly certain that there is a problem in the Spring Framework or would like
to suggest a feature, please use the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues[GitHub Issues].

If you have a solution in mind or a suggested fix, you can submit a pull request on
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework[Github]. However, please keep in mind
that, for all but the most trivial issues, we expect a ticket to be filed in the issue
tracker, where discussions take place and leave a record for future reference.

For more details see the guidelines at the
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md[CONTRIBUTING],
top-level project page.
