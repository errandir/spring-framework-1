== Introduction to Spring Testing

Testing is an integral part of enterprise software development. This chapter focuses on
the value added by the IoC principle to xref:unit-testing:unit-testing.adoc#unit-testing[unit testing] and on the benefits
of the Spring Framework's support for xref:integration-testing:integration-testing.adoc#integration-testing[integration testing]. (A
thorough treatment of testing in the enterprise is beyond the scope of this reference
manual.)
