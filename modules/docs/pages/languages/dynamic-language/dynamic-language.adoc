= Dynamic Language Support

Spring provides comprehensive support for using classes and objects that have been
defined by using a dynamic language (such as Groovy) with Spring. This support lets
you write any number of classes in a supported dynamic language and have the Spring
container transparently instantiate, configure, and dependency inject the resulting
objects.

Spring's scripting support primarily targets Groovy and BeanShell. Beyond those
specifically supported languages, the JSR-223 scripting mechanism is supported
for integration with any JSR-223 capable language provider (as of Spring 4.2),
e.g. JRuby.

You can find fully working examples of where this dynamic language support can be
immediately useful in xref:dynamic-language:dynamic-language-scenarios.adoc#dynamic-language-scenarios[dynamic-language-scenarios].
