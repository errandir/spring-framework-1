== Scenarios

The possible scenarios where defining Spring managed beans in a scripting language would
be beneficial are many and varied. This section describes two possible use cases for the
dynamic language support in Spring.



[[dynamic-language-scenarios-controllers]]
=== Scripted Spring MVC Controllers

One group of classes that can benefit from using dynamic-language-backed beans is that
of Spring MVC controllers. In pure Spring MVC applications, the navigational flow
through a web application is, to a large extent, determined by code encapsulated within
your Spring MVC controllers. As the navigational flow and other presentation layer logic
of a web application needs to be updated to respond to support issues or changing
business requirements, it may well be easier to effect any such required changes by
editing one or more dynamic language source files and seeing those changes being
immediately reflected in the state of a running application.

Remember that, in the lightweight architectural model espoused by projects such as
Spring, you typically aim to have a really thin presentation layer, with all
the meaty business logic of an application being contained in the domain and service
layer classes. Developing Spring MVC controllers as dynamic-language-backed beans lets
you change presentation layer logic by editing and saving text files. Any
changes to such dynamic language source files is (depending on the configuration)
automatically reflected in the beans that are backed by dynamic language source files.

NOTE: To effect this automatic "`pickup`" of any changes to dynamic-language-backed
beans, you have to enable the "`refreshable beans`" functionality. See
xref:dynamic-language:dynamic-language-beans:dynamic-language-beans-concepts.adoc#dynamic-language-refreshable-beans[dynamic-language-refreshable-beans] for a full treatment of this feature.

The following example shows an `org.springframework.web.servlet.mvc.Controller` implemented
by using the Groovy dynamic language:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	// from the file '/WEB-INF/groovy/FortuneController.groovy'
	package org.springframework.showcase.fortune.web

	import org.springframework.showcase.fortune.service.FortuneService
	import org.springframework.showcase.fortune.domain.Fortune
	import org.springframework.web.servlet.ModelAndView
	import org.springframework.web.servlet.mvc.Controller

	import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest
	import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse

	class FortuneController implements Controller {

		@Property FortuneService fortuneService

		ModelAndView handleRequest(HttpServletRequest request,
				HttpServletResponse httpServletResponse) {
			return new ModelAndView("tell", "fortune", this.fortuneService.tellFortune())
		}
	}
----

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<lang:groovy id="fortune"
			refresh-check-delay="3000"
			script-source="/WEB-INF/groovy/FortuneController.groovy">
		<lang:property name="fortuneService" ref="fortuneService"/>
	</lang:groovy>
----



[[dynamic-language-scenarios-validators]]
=== Scripted Validators

Another area of application development with Spring that may benefit from the
flexibility afforded by dynamic-language-backed beans is that of validation. It can
be easier to express complex validation logic by using a loosely typed dynamic language
(that may also have support for inline regular expressions) as opposed to regular Java.

Again, developing validators as dynamic-language-backed beans lets you change
validation logic by editing and saving a simple text file. Any such changes is
(depending on the configuration) automatically reflected in the execution of a
running application and would not require the restart of an application.

NOTE: To effect the automatic "`pickup`" of any changes to dynamic-language-backed
beans, you have to enable the 'refreshable beans' feature. See
xref:dynamic-language:dynamic-language-beans:dynamic-language-beans-concepts.adoc#dynamic-language-refreshable-beans[dynamic-language-refreshable-beans] for a full and detailed treatment of this feature.

The following example shows a Spring `org.springframework.validation.Validator`
implemented by using the Groovy dynamic language (see xref:validation:validator.adoc#validator[Validation using Springâ€™s Validator interface] for a discussion of the
`Validator` interface):

[source,groovy,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	import org.springframework.validation.Validator
	import org.springframework.validation.Errors
	import org.springframework.beans.TestBean

	class TestBeanValidator implements Validator {

		boolean supports(Class clazz) {
			return TestBean.class.isAssignableFrom(clazz)
		}

		void validate(Object bean, Errors errors) {
			if(bean.name?.trim()?.size() > 0) {
				return
			}
			errors.reject("whitespace", "Cannot be composed wholly of whitespace.")
		}
	}
