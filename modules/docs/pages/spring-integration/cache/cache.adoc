== Cache Abstraction

Since version 3.1, the Spring Framework provides support for transparently adding caching to
an existing Spring application. Similar to the xref:transaction:transaction.adoc#transaction[transaction]
support, the caching abstraction allows consistent use of various caching solutions with
minimal impact on the code.

As from Spring 4.1, the cache abstraction has been significantly extended with the
support of xref:cache:cache-jsr-107.adoc#cache-jsr-107[JSR-107 annotations] and more customization options.
