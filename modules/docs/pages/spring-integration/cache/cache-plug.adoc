=== Plugging-in Different Back-end Caches

Clearly, there are plenty of caching products out there that you can use as a backing
store. To plug them in, you need to provide a `CacheManager` and a `Cache` implementation,
since, unfortunately, there is no available standard that we can use instead.
This may sound harder than it is, since, in practice, the classes tend to be simple
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern[adapters] that map the caching abstraction
framework on top of the storage API, as the `ehcache` classes do. Most `CacheManager`
classes can use the classes in the `org.springframework.cache.support` package
(such as `AbstractCacheManager` which takes care of the boiler-plate code,
leaving only the actual mapping to be completed). We hope that, in time, the libraries
that provide integration with Spring can fill in this small configuration gap.
