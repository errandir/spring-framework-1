== JSR-305 meta-annotations

Spring annotations are meta-annotated with https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=305[JSR 305]
annotations (a dormant but wide-spread JSR). JSR-305 meta-annotations let tooling vendors
like IDEA or Kotlin provide null-safety support in a generic way, without having to
hard-code support for Spring annotations.

It is not necessary nor recommended to add a JSR-305 dependency to the project classpath to
take advantage of Spring null-safe API. Only projects such as Spring-based libraries that use
null-safety annotations in their codebase should add `com.google.code.findbugs:jsr305:3.0.2`
with `compileOnly` Gradle configuration or Maven `provided` scope to avoid compile warnings.
