== Use cases

In addition to providing an explicit declaration for Spring Framework API nullability,
these annotations can be used by an IDE (such as IDEA or Eclipse) to provide useful
warnings related to null-safety in order to avoid `NullPointerException` at runtime.

They are also used to make Spring API null-safe in Kotlin projects, since Kotlin natively
supports https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/null-safety.html[null-safety]. More details
are available in the xref:kotlin:kotlin-null-safety.adoc#kotlin-null-safety[Kotlin support documentation].
