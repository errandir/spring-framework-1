== Mixing Aspect Types

It is perfectly possible to mix @AspectJ style aspects by using the auto-proxying support,
schema-defined `<aop:aspect>` aspects, `<aop:advisor>` declared advisors, and even proxies
and interceptors in other styles in the same configuration. All of these are implemented
by using the same underlying support mechanism and can co-exist without any difficulty.
