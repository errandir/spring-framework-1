[[aop-schema]]
== Schema-based AOP Support

If you prefer an XML-based format, Spring also offers support for defining aspects
using the new `aop` namespace tags. The exact same pointcut expressions and advice kinds
as when using the @AspectJ style are supported. Hence, in this section we focus on
the new syntax and refer the reader to the discussion in the previous section
(xref:aop:aop-ataspectj.adoc#aop-ataspectj[aop-ataspectj]) for an understanding of writing pointcut expressions and the binding
of advice parameters.

To use the aop namespace tags described in this section, you need to import the
`spring-aop` schema, as described in xref:appendix:xsd-schemas.adoc#xsd-schemas[XML Schema-based configuration]. See xref:appendix:xsd-schemas:xsd-schemas-aop.adoc#xsd-schemas-aop[the AOP schema]
for how to import the tags in the `aop` namespace.

Within your Spring configurations, all aspect and advisor elements must be placed within
an `<aop:config>` element (you can have more than one `<aop:config>` element in an
application context configuration). An `<aop:config>` element can contain pointcut,
advisor, and aspect elements (note that these must be declared in that order).

WARNING: The `<aop:config>` style of configuration makes heavy use of Spring's
xref:aop-api:aop-autoproxy.adoc#aop-autoproxy[auto-proxying] mechanism. This can cause issues (such as advice
not being woven) if you already use explicit auto-proxying through the use of
`BeanNameAutoProxyCreator` or something similar. The recommended usage pattern is to
use either only the `<aop:config>` style or only the `AutoProxyCreator` style and
never mix them.



[[aop-schema-declaring-an-aspect]]
=== Declaring an Aspect

When you use the schema support, an aspect is a regular Java object defined as a bean in
your Spring application context. The state and behavior are captured in the fields and
methods of the object, and the pointcut and advice information are captured in the XML.

You can declare an aspect by using the <aop:aspect> element, and reference the backing bean
by using the `ref` attribute, as the following example shows:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<aop:config>
		<aop:aspect id="myAspect" ref="aBean">
			...
		</aop:aspect>
	</aop:config>

	<bean id="aBean" class="...">
		...
	</bean>
----

The bean that backs the aspect (`aBean` in this case) can of course be configured and
dependency injected just like any other Spring bean.



[[aop-schema-pointcuts]]
=== Declaring a Pointcut

You can declare a named pointcut inside an `<aop:config>` element, letting the pointcut
definition be shared across several aspects and advisors.

A pointcut that represents the execution of any business service in the service layer can
be defined as follows:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim"]
----
	<aop:config>

		<aop:pointcut id="businessService"
			expression="execution(* com.xyz.myapp.service.*.*(..))"/>

	</aop:config>
----

Note that the pointcut expression itself is using the same AspectJ pointcut expression
language as described in xref:aop:aop-ataspectj.adoc#aop-ataspectj[aop-ataspectj]. If you use the schema based declaration
style, you can refer to named pointcuts defined in types (@Aspects) within the
pointcut expression. Another way of defining the above pointcut would be as follows:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<aop:config>

		<aop:pointcut id="businessService"
			expression="com.xyz.myapp.SystemArchitecture.businessService()"/>

	</aop:config>
----

Assume that you have a `SystemArchitecture` aspect as described in xref:aop:aop-ataspectj:aop-pointcuts.adoc#aop-common-pointcuts[aop-common-pointcuts].

Then declaring a pointcut inside an aspect is very similar to declaring a top-level pointcut,
as the following example shows:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim"]
----
	<aop:config>

		<aop:aspect id="myAspect" ref="aBean">

			<aop:pointcut id="businessService"
				expression="execution(* com.xyz.myapp.service.*.*(..))"/>

			...

		</aop:aspect>

	</aop:config>
----

In much the same way as an @AspectJ aspect, pointcuts declared by using the schema based
definition style can collect join point context. For example, the following pointcut
collects the `this` object as the join point context and passes it to the advice:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim"]
----
	<aop:config>

		<aop:aspect id="myAspect" ref="aBean">

			<aop:pointcut id="businessService"
				expression="execution(* com.xyz.myapp.service.*.*(..)) &amp;&amp; this(service)"/>

			<aop:before pointcut-ref="businessService" method="monitor"/>

			...

		</aop:aspect>

	</aop:config>
----

The advice must be declared to receive the collected join point context by including
parameters of the matching names, as follows:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
.Java
----
	public void monitor(Object service) {
		// ...
	}
----
[source,kotlin,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="secondary"]
.Kotlin
----
	fun monitor(service: Any) {
		// ...
	}
----

When combining pointcut sub-expressions, `&&` is awkward within an XML document, so
you can use the `and`, `or`, and `not` keywords in place of `&&`, `||`, and `!`,
respectively. For example, the previous pointcut can be better written as follows:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim"]
----
	<aop:config>

		<aop:aspect id="myAspect" ref="aBean">

			<aop:pointcut id="businessService"
				expression="execution(* com.xyz.myapp.service.*.*(..)) and this(service)"/>

			<aop:before pointcut-ref="businessService" method="monitor"/>

			...
		</aop:aspect>
	</aop:config>
----

Note that pointcuts defined in this way are referred to by their XML `id` and cannot be
used as named pointcuts to form composite pointcuts. The named pointcut support in the
schema-based definition style is thus more limited than that offered by the @AspectJ
style.



[[aop-schema-advice]]
=== Declaring Advice

The schema-based AOP support uses the same five kinds of advice as the @AspectJ style, and they have
exactly the same semantics.


[[aop-schema-advice-before]]
==== Before Advice

Before advice runs before a matched method execution. It is declared inside an
`<aop:aspect>` by using the <aop:before> element, as the following example shows:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<aop:aspect id="beforeExample" ref="aBean">

		<aop:before
			pointcut-ref="dataAccessOperation"
			method="doAccessCheck"/>

		...

	</aop:aspect>
----

Here, `dataAccessOperation` is the `id` of a pointcut defined at the top (`<aop:config>`)
level. To define the pointcut inline instead, replace the `pointcut-ref` attribute with
a `pointcut` attribute, as follows:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim"]
----
	<aop:aspect id="beforeExample" ref="aBean">

		<aop:before
			pointcut="execution(* com.xyz.myapp.dao.*.*(..))"
			method="doAccessCheck"/>

		...

	</aop:aspect>
----

As we noted in the discussion of the @AspectJ style, using named pointcuts can
significantly improve the readability of your code.

The `method` attribute identifies a method (`doAccessCheck`) that provides the body of
the advice. This method must be defined for the bean referenced by the aspect element
that contains the advice. Before a data access operation is executed (a method execution
join point matched by the pointcut expression), the `doAccessCheck` method on the aspect
bean is invoked.


[[aop-schema-advice-after-returning]]
==== After Returning Advice

After returning advice runs when a matched method execution completes normally. It is
declared inside an `<aop:aspect>` in the same way as before advice. The following example
shows how to declare it:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<aop:aspect id="afterReturningExample" ref="aBean">

		<aop:after-returning
			pointcut-ref="dataAccessOperation"
			method="doAccessCheck"/>

		...

	</aop:aspect>
----

As in the @AspectJ style, you can get the return value within the
advice body. To do so, use the returning attribute to specify the name of the parameter to which
the return value should be passed, as the following example shows:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<aop:aspect id="afterReturningExample" ref="aBean">

		<aop:after-returning
			pointcut-ref="dataAccessOperation"
			returning="retVal"
			method="doAccessCheck"/>

		...

	</aop:aspect>
----

The `doAccessCheck` method must declare a parameter named `retVal`. The type of this
parameter constrains matching in the same way as described for `@AfterReturning`. For
example, you can declare the method signature as follows:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
.Java
----
	public void doAccessCheck(Object retVal) {...
----
[source,kotlin,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="secondary"]
.Kotlin
----
	fun doAccessCheck(retVal: Any) {...
----


[[aop-schema-advice-after-throwing]]
==== After Throwing Advice

After throwing advice executes when a matched method execution exits by throwing an
exception. It is declared inside an `<aop:aspect>` by using the after-throwing element,
as the following example shows:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<aop:aspect id="afterThrowingExample" ref="aBean">

		<aop:after-throwing
			pointcut-ref="dataAccessOperation"
			method="doRecoveryActions"/>

		...

	</aop:aspect>
----

As in the @AspectJ style, you can get the thrown exception within
the advice body. To do so, use the throwing attribute to specify the name of the parameter to
which the exception should be passed as the following example shows:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<aop:aspect id="afterThrowingExample" ref="aBean">

		<aop:after-throwing
			pointcut-ref="dataAccessOperation"
			throwing="dataAccessEx"
			method="doRecoveryActions"/>

		...

	</aop:aspect>
----

The `doRecoveryActions` method must declare a parameter named `dataAccessEx`. The type of
this parameter constrains matching in the same way as described for `@AfterThrowing`. For
example, the method signature may be declared as follows:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
.Java
----
	public void doRecoveryActions(DataAccessException dataAccessEx) {...
----
[source,kotlin,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="secondary"]
.Kotlin
----
	fun doRecoveryActions(dataAccessEx: DataAccessException) {...
----


[[aop-schema-advice-after-finally]]
==== After (Finally) Advice

After (finally) advice runs no matter how a matched method execution exits. You can declare it
by using the `after` element, as the following example shows:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<aop:aspect id="afterFinallyExample" ref="aBean">

		<aop:after
			pointcut-ref="dataAccessOperation"
			method="doReleaseLock"/>

		...

	</aop:aspect>
----


[[aop-schema-advice-around]]
==== Around Advice

The last kind of advice is around advice. Around advice runs "`around`" a matched method
execution. It has the opportunity to do work both before and after the method executes
and to determine when, how, and even if the method actually gets to execute at all.
Around advice is often used to share state before and after a method
execution in a thread-safe manner (starting and stopping a timer, for example). Always
use the least powerful form of advice that meets your requirements. Do not use around
advice if before advice can do the job.

You can declare around advice by using the `aop:around` element. The first parameter of the
advice method must be of type `ProceedingJoinPoint`. Within the body of the advice,
calling `proceed()` on the `ProceedingJoinPoint` causes the underlying method to
execute. The `proceed` method may also be called with an `Object[]`. The values
in the array are used as the arguments to the method execution when it proceeds. See
xref:aop:aop-ataspectj:aop-advice.adoc#aop-ataspectj-around-advice[aop-ataspectj-around-advice] for notes on calling `proceed` with an `Object[]`.
The following example shows how to declare around advice in XML:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<aop:aspect id="aroundExample" ref="aBean">

		<aop:around
			pointcut-ref="businessService"
			method="doBasicProfiling"/>

		...

	</aop:aspect>
----

The implementation of the `doBasicProfiling` advice can be exactly the same as in the
@AspectJ example (minus the annotation, of course), as the following example shows:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
.Java
----
	public Object doBasicProfiling(ProceedingJoinPoint pjp) throws Throwable {
		// start stopwatch
		Object retVal = pjp.proceed();
		// stop stopwatch
		return retVal;
	}
----
[source,kotlin,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="secondary"]
.Kotlin
----
	fun doBasicProfiling(pjp: ProceedingJoinPoint): Any {
		// start stopwatch
		val retVal = pjp.proceed()
		// stop stopwatch
		return pjp.proceed()
	}
----


[[aop-schema-params]]
==== Advice Parameters

The schema-based declaration style supports fully typed advice in the same way as
described for the @AspectJ support -- by matching pointcut parameters by name against
advice method parameters. See xref:aop:aop-ataspectj:aop-advice.adoc#aop-ataspectj-advice-params[aop-ataspectj-advice-params] for details. If you wish
to explicitly specify argument names for the advice methods (not relying on the
detection strategies previously described), you can do so by using the `arg-names`
attribute of the advice element, which is treated in the same manner as the `argNames`
attribute in an advice annotation (as described in xref:aop:aop-ataspectj:aop-advice.adoc#aop-ataspectj-advice-params-names[aop-ataspectj-advice-params-names]).
The following example shows how to specify an argument name in XML:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<aop:before
		pointcut="com.xyz.lib.Pointcuts.anyPublicMethod() and @annotation(auditable)"
		method="audit"
		arg-names="auditable"/>
----

The `arg-names` attribute accepts a comma-delimited list of parameter names.

The following slightly more involved example of the XSD-based approach shows
some around advice used in conjunction with a number of strongly typed parameters:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
.Java
----
	package x.y.service;

	public interface PersonService {

		Person getPerson(String personName, int age);
	}

	public class DefaultFooService implements FooService {

		public Person getPerson(String name, int age) {
			return new Person(name, age);
		}
	}
----
[source,kotlin,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="secondary"]
.Kotlin
----
	package x.y.service

	interface PersonService {

		fun getPerson(personName: String, age: Int): Person
	}

	class DefaultFooService : FooService {

		fun getPerson(name: String, age: Int): Person {
			return Person(name, age)
		}
	}
----

Next up is the aspect. Notice the fact that the `profile(..)` method accepts a number of
strongly-typed parameters, the first of which happens to be the join point used to
proceed with the method call. The presence of this parameter is an indication that the
`profile(..)` is to be used as `around` advice, as the following example shows:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
.Java
----
	package x.y;

	import org.aspectj.lang.ProceedingJoinPoint;
	import org.springframework.util.StopWatch;

	public class SimpleProfiler {

		public Object profile(ProceedingJoinPoint call, String name, int age) throws Throwable {
			StopWatch clock = new StopWatch("Profiling for '" + name + "' and '" + age + "'");
			try {
				clock.start(call.toShortString());
				return call.proceed();
			} finally {
				clock.stop();
				System.out.println(clock.prettyPrint());
			}
		}
	}
----
[source,kotlin,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="secondary"]
.Kotlin
----
	import org.aspectj.lang.ProceedingJoinPoint
	import org.springframework.util.StopWatch

	class SimpleProfiler {

		fun profile(call: ProceedingJoinPoint, name: String, age: Int): Any {
			val clock = StopWatch("Profiling for '$name' and '$age'")
			try {
				clock.start(call.toShortString())
				return call.proceed()
			} finally {
				clock.stop()
				println(clock.prettyPrint())
			}
		}
	}
----

Finally, the following example XML configuration effects the execution of the
preceding advice for a particular join point:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
		xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
		xmlns:aop="http://www.springframework.org/schema/aop"
		xsi:schemaLocation="
			http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans https://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
			http://www.springframework.org/schema/aop https://www.springframework.org/schema/aop/spring-aop.xsd">

		<!-- this is the object that will be proxied by Spring's AOP infrastructure -->
		<bean id="personService" class="x.y.service.DefaultPersonService"/>

		<!-- this is the actual advice itself -->
		<bean id="profiler" class="x.y.SimpleProfiler"/>

		<aop:config>
			<aop:aspect ref="profiler">

				<aop:pointcut id="theExecutionOfSomePersonServiceMethod"
					expression="execution(* x.y.service.PersonService.getPerson(String,int))
					and args(name, age)"/>

				<aop:around pointcut-ref="theExecutionOfSomePersonServiceMethod"
					method="profile"/>

			</aop:aspect>
		</aop:config>

	</beans>
----

Consider the following driver script:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
.Java
----
	import org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanFactory;
	import org.springframework.context.support.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext;
	import x.y.service.PersonService;

	public final class Boot {

		public static void main(final String[] args) throws Exception {
			BeanFactory ctx = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("x/y/plain.xml");
			PersonService person = (PersonService) ctx.getBean("personService");
			person.getPerson("Pengo", 12);
		}
	}
----
[source,kotlin,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="secondary"]
.Kotlin
----
	fun main() {
		val ctx = ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("x/y/plain.xml")
		val person = ctx.getBean("personService") as PersonService
		person.getPerson("Pengo", 12)
	}
----

With such a Boot class, we would get output similar to the following on standard output:

[literal,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
StopWatch 'Profiling for 'Pengo' and '12'': running time (millis) = 0
-----------------------------------------
ms     %     Task name
-----------------------------------------
00000  ?  execution(getFoo)
----


[[aop-ordering]]
==== Advice Ordering

When multiple advice needs to execute at the same join point (executing method) the
ordering rules are as described in xref:aop:aop-ataspectj:aop-advice.adoc#aop-ataspectj-advice-ordering[aop-ataspectj-advice-ordering]. The precedence
between aspects is determined by either adding the `Order` annotation to the bean
that backs the aspect or by having the bean implement the `Ordered` interface.



[[aop-schema-introductions]]
=== Introductions

Introductions (known as inter-type declarations in AspectJ) let an aspect declare
that advised objects implement a given interface and provide an implementation of
that interface on behalf of those objects.

You can make an introduction by using the `aop:declare-parents` element inside an `aop:aspect`.
You can use the `aop:declare-parents` element to declare that matching types have a new parent (hence the name).
For example, given an interface named `UsageTracked` and an implementation of that interface named
`DefaultUsageTracked`, the following aspect declares that all implementors of service
interfaces also implement the `UsageTracked` interface. (In order to expose statistics
through JMX for example.)

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<aop:aspect id="usageTrackerAspect" ref="usageTracking">

		<aop:declare-parents
			types-matching="com.xzy.myapp.service.*+"
			implement-interface="com.xyz.myapp.service.tracking.UsageTracked"
			default-impl="com.xyz.myapp.service.tracking.DefaultUsageTracked"/>

		<aop:before
			pointcut="com.xyz.myapp.SystemArchitecture.businessService()
				and this(usageTracked)"
				method="recordUsage"/>

	</aop:aspect>
----

The class that backs the `usageTracking` bean would then contain the following method:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
.Java
----
	public void recordUsage(UsageTracked usageTracked) {
		usageTracked.incrementUseCount();
	}
----
[source,kotlin,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="secondary"]
.Kotlin
----
	fun recordUsage(usageTracked: UsageTracked) {
		usageTracked.incrementUseCount()
	}
----

The interface to be implemented is determined by the `implement-interface` attribute. The
value of the `types-matching` attribute is an AspectJ type pattern. Any bean of a
matching type implements the `UsageTracked` interface. Note that, in the before
advice of the preceding example, service beans can be directly used as implementations of
the `UsageTracked` interface. To access a bean programmatically, you could write the
following:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
.Java
----
	UsageTracked usageTracked = (UsageTracked) context.getBean("myService");
----
[source,kotlin,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="secondary"]
.Kotlin
----
	val usageTracked = context.getBean("myService") as UsageTracked
----



[[aop-schema-instatiation-models]]
=== Aspect Instantiation Models

The only supported instantiation model for schema-defined aspects is the singleton
model. Other instantiation models may be supported in future releases.



[[aop-schema-advisors]]
=== Advisors

The concept of "`advisors`" comes from the AOP support defined in Spring
and does not have a direct equivalent in AspectJ. An advisor is like a small
self-contained aspect that has a single piece of advice. The advice itself is
represented by a bean and must implement one of the advice interfaces described in
xref:aop-api:aop-api-advice:aop-api-advice-types.adoc#aop-api-advice-types[aop-api-advice-types]. Advisors can take advantage of AspectJ pointcut expressions.

Spring supports the advisor concept with the `<aop:advisor>` element. You most
commonly see it used in conjunction with transactional advice, which also has its own
namespace support in Spring. The following example shows an advisor:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim"]
----
	<aop:config>

		<aop:pointcut id="businessService"
			expression="execution(* com.xyz.myapp.service.*.*(..))"/>

		<aop:advisor
			pointcut-ref="businessService"
			advice-ref="tx-advice"/>

	</aop:config>

	<tx:advice id="tx-advice">
		<tx:attributes>
			<tx:method name="*" propagation="REQUIRED"/>
		</tx:attributes>
	</tx:advice>
----

As well as the `pointcut-ref` attribute used in the preceding example, you can also use the
`pointcut` attribute to define a pointcut expression inline.

To define the precedence of an advisor so that the advice can participate in ordering,
use the `order` attribute to define the `Ordered` value of the advisor.



[[aop-schema-example]]
=== An AOP Schema Example

This section shows how the concurrent locking failure retry example from
xref:aop:aop-ataspectj:aop-ataspectj-example.adoc#aop-ataspectj-example[aop-ataspectj-example] looks when rewritten with the schema support.

The execution of business services can sometimes fail due to concurrency issues (for
example, a deadlock loser). If the operation is retried, it is likely to succeed
on the next try. For business services where it is appropriate to retry in such
conditions (idempotent operations that do not need to go back to the user for conflict
resolution), we want to transparently retry the operation to avoid the client seeing a
`PessimisticLockingFailureException`. This is a requirement that clearly cuts across
multiple services in the service layer and, hence, is ideal for implementing through an
aspect.

Because we want to retry the operation, we need to use around advice so that we can
call `proceed` multiple times. The following listing shows the basic aspect implementation
(which is a regular Java class that uses the schema support):

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
.Java
----
	public class ConcurrentOperationExecutor implements Ordered {

		private static final int DEFAULT_MAX_RETRIES = 2;

		private int maxRetries = DEFAULT_MAX_RETRIES;
		private int order = 1;

		public void setMaxRetries(int maxRetries) {
			this.maxRetries = maxRetries;
		}

		public int getOrder() {
			return this.order;
		}

		public void setOrder(int order) {
			this.order = order;
		}

		public Object doConcurrentOperation(ProceedingJoinPoint pjp) throws Throwable {
			int numAttempts = 0;
			PessimisticLockingFailureException lockFailureException;
			do {
				numAttempts++;
				try {
					return pjp.proceed();
				}
				catch(PessimisticLockingFailureException ex) {
					lockFailureException = ex;
				}
			} while(numAttempts <= this.maxRetries);
			throw lockFailureException;
		}

	}
----
[source,kotlin,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="secondary"]
.Kotlin
----
	class ConcurrentOperationExecutor : Ordered {

		private val DEFAULT_MAX_RETRIES = 2
		
		private var maxRetries = DEFAULT_MAX_RETRIES
		private var order = 1

		fun setMaxRetries(maxRetries: Int) {
			this.maxRetries = maxRetries
		}

		override fun getOrder(): Int {
			return this.order
		}

		fun setOrder(order: Int) {
			this.order = order
		}
		
		fun doConcurrentOperation(pjp: ProceedingJoinPoint): Any {
			var numAttempts = 0
			var lockFailureException: PessimisticLockingFailureException
			do {
				numAttempts++
				try {
					return pjp.proceed()
				} catch (ex: PessimisticLockingFailureException) {
					lockFailureException = ex
				}

			} while (numAttempts <= this.maxRetries)
			throw lockFailureException
		}
	}
----

Note that the aspect implements the `Ordered` interface so that we can set the precedence of
the aspect higher than the transaction advice (we want a fresh transaction each time we
retry). The `maxRetries` and `order` properties are both configured by Spring. The
main action happens in the `doConcurrentOperation` around advice method. We try to
proceed. If we fail with a `PessimisticLockingFailureException`, we try again,
unless we have exhausted all of our retry attempts.

NOTE: This class is identical to the one used in the @AspectJ example, but with the
annotations removed.

The corresponding Spring configuration is as follows:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim"]
----
	<aop:config>

		<aop:aspect id="concurrentOperationRetry" ref="concurrentOperationExecutor">

			<aop:pointcut id="idempotentOperation"
				expression="execution(* com.xyz.myapp.service.*.*(..))"/>

			<aop:around
				pointcut-ref="idempotentOperation"
				method="doConcurrentOperation"/>

		</aop:aspect>

	</aop:config>

	<bean id="concurrentOperationExecutor"
		class="com.xyz.myapp.service.impl.ConcurrentOperationExecutor">
			<property name="maxRetries" value="3"/>
			<property name="order" value="100"/>
	</bean>
----

Notice that, for the time, being we assume that all business services are idempotent. If
this is not the case, we can refine the aspect so that it retries only genuinely
idempotent operations, by introducing an `Idempotent` annotation and using the annotation
to annotate the implementation of service operations, as the following example shows:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
.Java
----
	@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
	public @interface Idempotent {
		// marker annotation

The
change to the aspect to retry only idempotent operations involves refining the

			expression="execution(* com.xyz.myapp.service.*.*(..)) and
			@annotation(com.xyz.myapp.service.Idempotent)"/>
