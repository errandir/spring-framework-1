== `DataBuffer`

The `DataBuffer` interface offers similar operations as `java.nio.ByteBuffer` but also
brings a few additional benefits some of which are inspired by the Netty `ByteBuf`.
Below is a partial list of benefits:

* Read and write with independent positions, i.e. not requiring a call to `flip()` to
alternate between read and write.
* Capacity expanded on demand as with `java.lang.StringBuilder`.
* Pooled buffers and reference counting via xref:databuffers:databuffers-buffer-pooled.adoc#databuffers-buffer-pooled[databuffers-buffer-pooled].
* View a buffer as `java.nio.ByteBuffer`, `InputStream`, or `OutputStream`.
* Determine the index, or the last index, for a given byte.
