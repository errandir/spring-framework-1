= Data Buffers and Codecs

Java NIO provides `ByteBuffer` but many libraries build their own byte buffer API on top,
especially for network operations where reusing buffers and/or using direct buffers is
beneficial for performance. For example Netty has the `ByteBuf` hierarchy, Undertow uses
XNIO, Jetty uses pooled byte buffers with a callback to be released, and so on.
The `spring-core` module provides a set of abstractions to work with various byte buffer
APIs as follows:

* xref:databuffers:databuffers-factory.adoc#databuffers-factory[databuffers-factory] abstracts the creation of a data buffer.
* xref:databuffers:databuffers-buffer.adoc#databuffers-buffer[databuffers-buffer] represents a byte buffer, which may be
xref:databuffers:databuffers-buffer-pooled.adoc#databuffers-buffer-pooled[pooled].
* xref:databuffers:databuffers-utils.adoc#databuffers-utils[databuffers-utils] offers utility methods for data buffers.
* xref:databuffers:codecs.adoc#Codecs[Codecs] decode or encode streams data buffer streams into higher level objects.
