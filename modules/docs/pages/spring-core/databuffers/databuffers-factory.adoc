== `DataBufferFactory`

`DataBufferFactory` is used to create data buffers in one of two ways:

. Allocate a new data buffer, optionally specifying capacity upfront, if known, which is
more efficient even though implementations of `DataBuffer` can grow and shrink on demand.
. Wrap an existing `byte[]` or `java.nio.ByteBuffer`, which decorates the given data with
a `DataBuffer` implementation and that does not involve allocation.

Note that WebFlux applications do not create a `DataBufferFactory` directly but instead
access it through the `ServerHttpResponse` or the `ClientHttpRequest` on the client side.
The type of factory depends on the underlying client or server, e.g.
`NettyDataBufferFactory` for Reactor Netty, `DefaultDataBufferFactory` for others.
