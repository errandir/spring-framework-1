The original web framework included in the Spring Framework, Spring Web MVC, was
purpose-built for the Servlet API and Servlet containers. The reactive-stack web framework,
Spring WebFlux, was added later in version 5.0. It is fully non-blocking, supports
https://www.reactive-streams.org/[Reactive Streams] back pressure, and runs on such servers as
Netty, Undertow, and Servlet 3.1+ containers.

Both web frameworks mirror the names of their source modules
(https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/tree/master/spring-webmvc[spring-webmvc] and
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/tree/master/spring-webflux[spring-webflux])
and co-exist side by side in the Spring Framework. Each module is optional.
Applications can use one or the other module or, in some cases, both --
for example, Spring MVC controllers with the reactive `WebClient`.
