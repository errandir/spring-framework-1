== `WebClient`

`WebClient` is a non-blocking, reactive client to perform HTTP requests. It was
introduced in 5.0 and offers a modern alternative to the `RestTemplate`, with efficient
support for both synchronous and asynchronous, as well as streaming scenarios.

In contrast to `RestTemplate`, `WebClient` supports the following:

* Non-blocking I/O.
* Reactive Streams back pressure.
* High concurrency with fewer hardware resources.
* Functional-style, fluent API that takes advantage of Java 8 lambdas.
* Synchronous and asynchronous interactions.
* Streaming up to or streaming down from a server.
