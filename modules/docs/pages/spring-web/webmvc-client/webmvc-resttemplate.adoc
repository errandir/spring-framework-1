== `RestTemplate`

`RestTemplate` is a synchronous client to perform HTTP requests. It is the original
Spring REST client and exposes a simple, template-method API over underlying HTTP client
libraries.

NOTE: As of 5.0, the non-blocking, reactive `WebClient` offers a modern alternative to the
`RestTemplate`, with efficient support for both
xref:webflux-client:webflux-client-synchronous.adoc#webflux-client-synchronous[synchronous and asynchronous], as well as
streaming scenarios. The `RestTemplate` will be deprecated in a future version and will
not have major new features added going forward.


See xref:remoting:rest-client-access.adoc#rest-client-access[REST Endpoints] for details.
