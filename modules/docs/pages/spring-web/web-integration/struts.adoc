== Apache Struts 2.x

Invented by Craig McClanahan, https://struts.apache.org[Struts] is an open-source project
hosted by the Apache Software Foundation. At the time, it greatly simplified the
JSP/Servlet programming paradigm and won over many developers who were using proprietary
frameworks. It simplified the programming model, it was open source (and thus free as in
beer), and it had a large community, which let the project grow and become popular among
Java web developers.

As a successor to the original Struts 1.x, check out Struts 2.x and the Struts-provided
https://struts.apache.org/release/2.3.x/docs/spring-plugin.html[Spring Plugin] for the
built-in Spring integration.
