= Other Web Frameworks

This chapter details Spring's integration with third-party web frameworks.

One of the core value propositions of the Spring Framework is that of enabling
_choice_. In a general sense, Spring does not force you to use or buy into any
particular architecture, technology, or methodology (although it certainly recommends
some over others). This freedom to pick and choose the architecture, technology, or
methodology that is most relevant to a developer and their development team is
arguably most evident in the web area, where Spring provides its own web frameworks
(xref:mvc:mvc.adoc#mvc[Spring MVC] and xref:webflux:webflux.adoc#webflux[Spring WebFlux]) while, at the same time,
supporting integration with a number of popular third-party web frameworks.
