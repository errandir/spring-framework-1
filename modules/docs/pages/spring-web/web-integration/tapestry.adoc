== Apache Tapestry 5.x

https://tapestry.apache.org/[Tapestry] is a ""Component oriented framework for creating
dynamic, robust, highly scalable web applications in Java.""

While Spring has its own xref:mvc:mvc.adoc#mvc[powerful web layer], there are a number of unique
advantages to building an enterprise Java application by using a combination of Tapestry
for the web user interface and the Spring container for the lower layers.

For more information, see Tapestry's dedicated
