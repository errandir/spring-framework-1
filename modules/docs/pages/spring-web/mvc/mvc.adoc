Spring Web MVC is the original web framework built on the Servlet API and has been included
in the Spring Framework from the very beginning. The formal name, "`Spring Web MVC,`"
comes from the name of its source module
(https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/tree/master/spring-webmvc[`spring-webmvc`]),
but it is more commonly known as "`Spring MVC`".

Parallel to Spring Web MVC, Spring Framework 5.0 introduced a reactive-stack web framework
whose name, "`Spring WebFlux,`" is also based on its source module
(https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/tree/master/spring-webflux[`spring-webflux`]).
This section covers Spring Web MVC. The xref:.adoc#spring-web-reactive[next section]
covers Spring WebFlux.

For baseline information and compatibility with Servlet container and Java EE version
ranges, see the Spring Framework
