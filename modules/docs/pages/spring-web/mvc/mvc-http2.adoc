== HTTP/2
[.small]#xref:webflux:webflux-http2.adoc#webflux-http2[WebFlux]#

Servlet 4 containers are required to support HTTP/2, and Spring Framework 5 is compatible
with Servlet API 4. From a programming model perspective, there is nothing specific that
applications need to do. However, there are considerations related to server configuration.
For more details, see the
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/wiki/HTTP-2-support[HTTP/2 wiki page].

The Servlet API does expose one construct related to HTTP/2. You can use the
`javax.servlet.http.PushBuilder` proactively push resources to clients, and it
is supported as a xref:mvc:mvc-controller:mvc-ann-methods.adoc#mvc-ann-arguments[method argument] to `@RequestMapping` methods.
